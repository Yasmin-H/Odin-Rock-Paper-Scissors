# Project 3 of the Odin Project : Rock Paper Scissors 


### Project Overview :

My 3rd task in the Odin Project was to develop my problem solving skills using my current knowledge on JavaScript. I will be creating a simple JavaScript game from scratch. 

My game is played against the computer called Rock , Paper Or Scissors. Will have a  

- getComputerChoice function that will randomly return one of the 3 choices 
- getHumanChoice function that takes the user choice and returns it
- playRound function that takes the human and computer player choices as arguments , plays a single round , increments the round winner's score and logs a winner annoucement.
- playGame function that call playRound function to play up to 5 rounds , keeps track of the scores and declares a winner at the end. 


### Reflection 

I realised that there are many ways of doing this task. I decided for the getComputerChoice to make use of the math.random() and for the getHumanChoice it just relied on the user input which I used prompts for. However , it was at this stage I realised that I was using too many if/else statements that were neither DRY or clean code. So I quickly researched other ways on to make it more practical. 

For me , I could have continued using if/else statements but I want to become a better coder , even if that makes this assignment 10x more harder :joy:
